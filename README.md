# Outpatient-Encounter-Checker-VGH

### _Disclamier_
At the moment, the app is for VGH-TPE internal use only. You won't be able to access the url coded in this repo with external IP.

## Introduction
This CLI app help you check whether patients who've booked an appointment are new to the department in an automated way.

## Problem to solve
Because fresh case in radiation oncology requires extensive efforts to figure out previous clinical course of the patient, we often look into the patient's history the day before their appointment so we don't have to spent to much time on the computer during the appointment. Currently, we have to click into each patient one by one manually to find out whether a paitent is new to our department or not. The task quickly becomes a waste of time when there are > 40 patients to check.

## How to start
```
python dev.py
```
